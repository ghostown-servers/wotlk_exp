[ script:ox_inventory] [warning] Database contains 70 items.
[ script:ox_inventory] [warning] These items should be removed, and any queries for items should instead reference ESX.Items
[ script:ox_inventory] [warning] These entries are no longer removed to satisfy the creators of obfuscated and encrypted resources.
[ script:ox_inventory] [warning] Note: Any items that exist in item data and not the database will not work in said resources.
[ script:ox_inventory] [warning] Apparently indexing ESX.Items is too big brain, or something.
